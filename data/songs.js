		'text': "\tThe sky shone a royal purple, with small yet bright stars scattered across it like freckles. A few stray clouds flew below the sky as a gray foregroud. Below it all, I lied on a hill– facing the beautiful painting of space above. The hill, covered in tall yellow grass that peacefully fluttered in the light breeze, was perfectly angles for admiring the sky.\n\tAuo turned to face me, \"You're lost, aren't you?\"\n\t\"It's beautiful though, how can one not?\"\n\t\"What a simpleton you are, too lost in the sky to pay attention to yourself.\"\n\t\"Well, I've only been sitting here for a week.\"\n\t\"A week? How absurd. Of course, that must sound like no time at all for a person like you.\"\n\t\"Can you blame me? Immortality can get boring. But, of course, there are goods and bads that come with everything.\"\n\t\"Such and idiot. I envy your simpleminded way of looking at things. Life must be so much easier.\"\n\t\"Well when you've lived so long and seen so much, theres a level of desensitization that comes with it.\"\n\tAuo didn't give a response.\n\t\"What is it like,\" I asked, \"knowing that someday you might lose your life?\"\n\tAuo stayed silent. I looked down from the beautiful sky and over at them. To me, they were just someone else and no one important. I had known many people, most of which had died, to really care much about them.\n\t\"You're a fool, a true idiot to say the least,\" they finally answered, \"This world will not last forever and one day it will cease to be here. By this point I will most assuredly be long gone, but what about you? Will you still be here– looking up at the sky?.\"\n\tIt was a good question, one that I was not sure I knew the answer to myself. \"Nothing really lasts forever, does it? At that point, I will cease to exist myself.\"\n\tAuo chuckled a little at my answer, \"I guess even immortality has its limits. How strange. It seems to render the point of immortality useless, does it not?\"\n\tI smiled, \"I guess you could say that.\""
